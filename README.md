# Hi, I am Vighnesh. <img src="./assets/wave.gif" width="30px" />

I am currently working as a `Software Engineer III (L4)` at `Google` as part of `Feedback & Happiness Tracking Surveys (HaTS)` team. These services are leveraged by partner teams across all Google products to collect user feedback and conduct product surveys.

Previously, I worked at `Microsoft` for almost 4 years in the `Azure Functions` and the `Azure Container Apps` teams.

For my education, I graduated with a double major in `Computer Science & Mathematics` from `BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus` in July, 2021.
